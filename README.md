CloudMOOBenchmark
=================

#Introduction
The CloudMOOBenchmark project aims to provide a benchmark use case to test the performance of Multi-Objective Optimization 
algorithms on real-world problems. Traditional existing benchmarks involve mathematical functions such as the DTLZ suites.

#Problem Statement
- There are many cloud providers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Rackspace, etc...). Each having different types of virtual machines with different specifications (CPU, RAM, hard disk, Networking), at a different price. 
- There are different online softwares. Each requires specific hardware allocation, has its own software requirements in term of dependencies on other softwares, and has other set of requirements (Security,latency, etc.)
-
